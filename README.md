# Python-codes

This repository contains python programs and their output as a part of my learning in data analytics,python,pandas and other related libraries.


## A few interesting tasks that I have completed as a part of hackathons and coding tests  



1. Exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using a property loan sanction data set as a part of case study for Cipla Data Science hiring process.

2. A cricket game simulation program as a part of coding test on Geektrust. Though the initial problem statement was to simulate a cricket game situation, I had extended the scope by writing another program to simulate the game many number of times. I collected data from the outcomes of these games and performed visualizations to draw insights.

3. Visualizing decision boundaries of different machine learning algorithms for classifying data belonging to 2 different classes. I did this out of self interest. The data was arranged in different ways and the corresponding decision boundaries of machine learning algorithms was observed.
